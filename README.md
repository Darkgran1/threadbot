### TODO

- [x] Show `Thread Bot is typing` whenever someone types so the person remembers to use thread
- [ ] ~Automatically unshare files from channels so comments don't flood the channel~<br/>
    - _Slack API doesn't allow bots do this ðŸ˜•_
    - _This will be fixed: File comments will work just like threads after July 19th ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ ([source](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2018-05-file-threads-soon-tread))_
- [x] `/thread` command to remind everyone in the channel about this Thread Culture
- [x] Action menu on each message so anyone can make the bot reply to a person that is not using threads
- [ ] Distribute app: Make it work for any workspace
